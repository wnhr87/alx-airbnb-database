## 🗃️ Database Design

### Key Entities and Fields

1. **Users**
   - id (Primary Key)
   - username
   - email
   - password_hash
   - is_host (Boolean)

2. **Properties**
   - id
   - title
   - description
   - location
   - owner_id (ForeignKey to Users)

3. **Bookings**
   - id
   - user_id
   - property_id
   - check_in
   - check_out

4. **Payments**
   - id
   - booking_id
   - amount
   - payment_status

5. **Reviews**
   - id
   - property_id
   - user_id
   - rating
   - comment

### Relationships

- A **User** can create multiple **Properties**.
- A **Booking** is made by a **User** for a specific **Property**.
- A **Payment** is linked to a **Booking**.
- A **Review** is written by a **User** for a **Property**.

## 🧩 Feature Breakdown

- **User Management**: Registration, login, profile management.
- **Property Management**: Hosts can add, update, or delete property listings.
- **Booking System**: Users can check availability and make bookings.
- **Payment Processing**: Secure payment handling for confirmed bookings.
- **Review System**: Users can leave reviews and rate their experience.

## 🔐 API Security

- **Authentication**: Secure user login via tokens (JWT or DRF Auth).
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (e.g., only owners can edit their listings).
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent API abuse by limiting requests.
- **Input Validation**: Sanitize and validate all incoming data.
- **HTTPS**: Ensures encrypted communication for data protection.

Security is critical for:
- Protecting personal data (users, payments).
- Preventing unauthorized access to resources.
- Avoiding financial fraud or data leaks.

## 🔁 CI/CD Pipeline

CI/CD pipelines automate testing and deployment to improve efficiency.

- **CI (Continuous Integration)**: Runs tests on each code push using tools like GitHub Actions.
- **CD (Continuous Deployment)**: Automatically deploys updates using Docker and cloud services.

**Tools:**
- GitHub Actions
- Docker
- Postgres (in containerized environment)
